<h1>Github Jobs Search</h1>
<h2>Project Entry from <a href="https://devchallenges.io/challenges/TtUjDt19eIHxNQ4n5jps">Devchallenges.io</a></h2>

<h2>Project Details</h2>
<p>The Github Jobs API Project is a challenge to build an interface to utilize the Github Jobs API endpoint. The API provides the abilities to custom tailor searches based on various criteria (location, description, full-time, etc). API results are limited to a maximum of 50 jobs returned per query, with the ability to use pagination to fetch more.</p>
<h2>Live Demo</h2>
<p>Please Note: I use cors-anywhere as a way to proxy calls to the Github API (as the project challenge had suggested). Unfortunately, cors-anywhere had to limit the use of the proxy. So there is <strong>one necessary step</strong> in order to view the project on the live site:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Visit <a href="https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo">cors-anywhere.com/corsdemo</a></li>
    <li>click on the "Request Temporary Access to the Demo Server" button</li>
    <li>Check out the project here: <a href="https://joblistingsreact.netlify.app/">Github Jobs Challenge</a>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>You can read about the additional step to clicking on the demo button here: <a href="https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/issues/301">Issue #301</a></p>

<h2>How to Install</h2>
<p>To view the project and run it locally, simply click on the download button above or clone the repo. <strong>You will need to have Node/NPM installed</strong>. Once the project is downloaded or cloned, simply run <code>npm install</code> to install all of the node libraries (React, etc). <br>
<code>npm run start</code> will run the project locally.</p>
