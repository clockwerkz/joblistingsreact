<h1>Github Jobs Search</h1>
<h2>Project Entry from <a href="https://devchallenges.io/challenges/TtUjDt19eIHxNQ4n5jps">Devchallenges.io</a></h2>

<h2>Project Details</h2>
<p>The Github Jobs API Project is a challenge to build an interface to utilize the Github Jobs API endpoint. The API provides the abilities to custom tailor searches based on various criteria (location, description, full-time, etc). API results are limited to a maximum of 50 jobs returned per query, with the ability to use pagination to fetch more.</p>
<h2>Live Demo</h2>
<p>Please Note: I use my own cors-anywhere implementation as a way to proxy calls to the Github API (as the project challenge had suggested). My proxy is hosted on heroku, <strong>so your first search may make a few seconds to spin up.</strong></p>
